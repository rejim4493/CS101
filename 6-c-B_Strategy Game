/*模擬回合制得分：J 位玩家、R 回合；根據每回合輸入的名次（或勝者）累加分數，最後輸出得分最高者（依題意處理同分規則／索引基底）。*/
/*
A strategy game with J players is played around a table. Players are identified by numbers from 1 to
J and will play a total of R rounds.
At each round each player will play once, in the order of their identifiers; that is, player 1 will play
first, player 2 will play second, and so on. Once player J plays, the round is complete, and a next round
starts.
A player earns a certain amount of Victory Points every time she or he plays. After all rounds are
finished the total points of each player is computed as the sum of Victory Points the player earned on
each round. The winner is the player with the maximum number of points; in case of a tie the winner
is the player who earned the maximum number of points and played last.
Given the number of players, the number of rounds and a list describing the Victory Points in the
order they were obtained, you must determine which player is the winner.
Input
The input contains several test cases. In each test case, the first line contains two integers J and R,
respectively the number of players and the number turns (1 ≤ J, R ≤ 500). The second line contains
J ∗ R integers, representing the Victory Points earned by each player in each turn, in the order they
happened. The Victory Points obtained in each turn will be always integer numbers between 0 and
100, inclusive.
Output
For each test case in the input, your program must produce one single line, containing the integer
representing the winner.
Sample Input
3 3
1 1 1 1 2 2 2 3 3
2 3
0 0 1 0 2 0
Sample Output
3
1

J代表總共有幾位玩家
